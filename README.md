## NetTalk
# What is NetTalk?
NetTalk is a chatting project created by me and Ad2017 (github - ad2017gd)
We want to create a public web-chatting app for users to talk with friends, other people or just have fun.

## Test it yourself
After downloading NetTalk's source you have to install node.js and run `dependecies.bat`. After everything is installed start the Server by running `start.bat`
